# [Llama Joy](http://llama-joy.herokuapp.com/)

Llama Joy is an e-commerce website that sells llama-inspired baby shoes.

## Design decisions

* I choose to implement an one-page website since clicking increases frictions. An one-pager makes it easy for users to scroll down and learn more about the product. It's minimum effort and it gives the company the maximum amount of chance to convert the user.
* I choose to make the site response using Bootstrap, especially because of the increasing mobile usage. Websites have to be user-friendly on all devices.
* I choose to add a hover effect for the relevant products. When a user hover over a product, he/she can see details of the product. This design adds dynamic to the page and increases user engagement.
* I choose to let the icons gradually show up one after another, as well as the buttons rise slowly. These also increase the dynamic of the page.
* I choose Open Sans as a major font, and Merriweather for the paragraphs. They go nicely together. Backup fonts are included.
* I choose #f05d62, #fff, #222 as the palette. I choose #f05d62 as the highlighter because it is a warm color giving the customers a comfortable feeling. It is also similar to the color of the baby shoes.

## Framework & tools

* I use html, css, javascript and jQuery for the website.
* Since this page is only front-end, I decide to only use html, css, JS. However, to build a more complex e-commerce web page, I will consider either to use express.js with handlebars, or react.js. Handlebars is particularly good for website with multiple pages, as all the pages can be based on layout.hbs. Express.js allows javascript to be used across the stack, and makes it convenient to hook the front-end and the back-end. React is very helpful for websites that are super dynamic. The react state machine manages changes without needing to reload the whole page.
* I use bootstrap for the responsive navbar as well as buttons. Bootstrap also helps me make the page responsive.
* I use fontawesome for the icons, unsplash.com for the cover photo.
* I use ScrollReveal for the scroll effect.
* I model the page after a bootstrap template.

## About me

I am Mojia, studying Computer Science and Psychology at Wellesley College. I am a passionate software engineer and entrepreneur. Check out my [personal website] here: (http://mojiashen.com),  my [past projects] (http://mojiashen.com/project.html), as well as my [Github] (https://github.com/Mojiashen1). I started on CS just last semester! But my learning has been exponential.

I am excited about front-end engineering because it is the work that shapes how we see and feel. I know different layouts, colors, animations can give the user a totally different experience, and therefore different business results. I am particularly excited about being a front end engineer because there are so many great frameworks and tools that empower us to build better interfaces. I want to realize the great UX/UI work the designers do and impact the product! My course work in CS and Psychology gives me the solid skill set to program interactive web pages, as well as the insights of how to build products that get users hooked. I am excited about this opportunity to intern at Zappos!
